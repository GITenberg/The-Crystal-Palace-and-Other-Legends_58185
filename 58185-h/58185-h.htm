<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2></div>


<p>Legends have a fascination for all
classes of people, but they possess a peculiar
charm for children. They constitute,
in fact, a form of literature particularly
fitting to the mental world of the child.
In them fact and fancy are happily
blended. Around the bare facts of recorded
or unrecorded history, are woven
the poetic ideals of a romantic people.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more worth a child&#8217;s
reading than a story of the past that conveys
not only an idea of the everyday life
of real people, but represents them also as
striving after ideals in various forms of
beauty.</p>

<p>No influence is greater than the moral
force of beauty. In the present volume
the purpose of the writers has been to present
only such legends as reveal simplicity,
strength, and beauty. These qualities
make their inevitable appeal to the child
fancy.</p>

<p>The subject matter of the book has been
graded for children of eight or ten years.
It is, therefore, well suited for use as a
supplementary reader in the fourth or fifth
grade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CRYSTAL PALACE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many,</span> many years ago there lived in
the village of Zurdorf, a queer little old
woman. She was a very kind old lady
and a good nurse. Often she was called
upon to care for the boys and girls of the
village.</p>

<p>They quite enjoyed being ill because she
knew so many interesting stories. She
told them of great knights and ladies, of
castles and fairies, of the wood nymphs
and the water sprites; but best of all was
the story of old Father Rhine.</p>

<p>One night as she sat knitting, a knock
came at the cottage door. She opened it
and there stood a strange man, carrying a
lantern of curious pattern. He did not
speak, but motioned to her to follow him.</p>

<p>The night was dark, and the rain was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
pouring down in torrents. Great pools
were found in the streets. Aunt Margot,
as the children called the old lady, hesitated
to follow the stranger. It was not,
however, because she was afraid of the
storm, but because the man was a stranger.</p>

<p>He motioned to her again. She saw
that his face was kindly, and so decided to
follow him. Down the dark street they
passed, splashing through the deep pools
of water.</p>

<p>Suddenly the water became deeper, and
began to eddy about Margot&#8217;s ankles.
She became frightened and was about to
turn and flee.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go no farther,&#8221; she shouted;
&#8220;what manner of man art thou, and
whither wouldst thou lead me?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old man did not answer, but caught
Margot in his arms and plunged into the
river Rhine. It had risen from its banks,
and its eddying waters had frightened
Margot.</p>

<p>Down, down, through cold green waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
they sank. It seemed to Margot as if she
were going down forever. She closed her
eyes and ceased to struggle.</p>

<p>At last they seemed to have passed out
of the water, and Margot opened her eyes.
She found herself in a wonderful crystal
palace. Precious stones glittered all
about her. The ornaments were of silver
and gold. As soon as she had recovered
from her wonder, she was led into an immense
chamber. Here on a bed of crystal,
with silken coverings, lay a beautiful
golden haired nymph, who was ill.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have brought you here,&#8221; said the old
man, &#8220;to care for my beautiful wife.
Nurse her tenderly back to health, and
you shall never regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lovely nymph was so good to look
upon that old Margot took great delight
in caring for her. She tended her so
gently and so faithfully that the golden
haired lady improved rapidly. She was
soon quite well.</p>

<p>In soft whispers she told the old nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that her husband was a mighty water
spirit. Mortals called him Father Rhine.
She had lived on the earth and was the
only daughter of the Lord of Rheidt.</p>

<p>One day when she was at a village
dance, there appeared before her a strange
man. He was clad in foamy green. He
asked her to tread a measure with him.
Round and round they whirled until they
reached the water edge. Suddenly he
plunged with her into the stream, and
brought her to the crystal palace, where
he made her his happy wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;And now, kind nurse, we must soon
part,&#8221; said the beautiful lady. &#8220;When
Father Rhine offers to reward you, accept
from him only your usual fee, no matter
how much he urges you to take more. He
loves honesty, but loathes greed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Father Rhine appeared. Seeing
his beloved wife quite well again, the
river god beckoned to the nurse to follow
him. He led her through many halls of
the great castle. Finally they came to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
treasure chamber. Here all around lay
great heaps of gold, silver, and precious
stones.</p>

<p>The water god was very grateful to the
good nurse for saving his wife; so he bade
her help herself. The old woman gazed
upon the jewels longingly. How well she
could use them to help the poor! She remembered,
however, what the beautiful
golden haired lady had told her. So she
selected only a small fee such as she always
received. The mysterious man
urged her to take more, but she firmly refused.</p>

<p>Then the great water god took her by
the hand and led her through a long dark
corridor. Suddenly she found herself
again in the cold water of the Rhine.
Slowly he rose with her through the dark
flood. Up and up they went until she
found herself, dripping but safe, on the
shore near her own house. As he beckoned
adieu to her, Father Rhine flung a
whole handful of gold into her lap. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
he plunged into the river again and was
gone.</p>

<p>Ever since that time the little people of
the village have loved to hear of the wonders
of the crystal palace beneath the flood.
So the good nurse tells it over and over
again. And she never forgets to show
the handful of gold which, she says, is the
same Father Rhine gave her.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE ANGEL PAGE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">A handsome</span> lad once sought a brave
and noble knight, asking leave to serve
him as page. The knight was greatly
charmed by the graceful manners of the
young lad, and was pleased with his unusual
request. He granted the lad&#8217;s
prayer, and never once did he have cause
to regret it.</p>

<p>The little page did every duty with
great cheerfulness and skill. He was so
devoted to his master that he was able to
foresee almost every wish. It was not
long before he had won his master&#8217;s love,
and the two became constant comrades.</p>

<p>The years passed swiftly by. The
knight had never before been so happy,
and never so successful. Everything
seemed to turn out just as he wished it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Nothing had gone wrong since the day
that the little page had entered his gate.</p>

<p>One day as the two were riding along
the banks of the Rhine, they noticed a
band of robbers coming toward them.
These men had often sought to harm the
good knight. The band was so large that
it was easy to see that the brave knight
could make no headway against them.
There seemed to be no way of escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would to God,&#8221; cried the brave man,
&#8220;that you were safe within my castle walls,
my faithful little page! We are lost, my
lad, but we must sell our lives as dearly as
possible. Let us die like heroes. Do you
get behind me, my page, and, if possible,
I bid you flee.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear master,&#8221; replied the little
page, &#8220;follow me. I will show you a way
to escape. Follow me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The page put spurs to his horse and galloped
along the river bank. Suddenly he
turned the unwilling steed directly into
the rushing stream.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8220;Rash boy, come back!&#8221; called the
knight, dashing forward with the hope of
overtaking the daring page. &#8220;Better die
fighting bravely than perish miserably in
the river. Come back, my page, come
back!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have no fear, my dear master, but follow
me,&#8221; still cried the little page.</p>

<p>The sound of his voice rose so confidently
above the noise of the wind and
waves that the knight obeyed, hardly
knowing what he was doing. A few minutes
later the horses had found a firm footing
in the river. Guided by the faithful
little page, the knight safely forded the
stream. He reached the farther shore
just as his enemies came down to the
water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>The angry robbers urged their steeds
into the deep water, but no trace of ford
could be found and they were forced to
give up the pursuit.</p>

<p>The knight&#8217;s love for the little page
was greatly increased after this, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
little page, too, seemed to love his master
more and more. He was only happy
when in his master&#8217;s presence or when doing
some errand for him.</p>

<p>A short time after this happy escape
from death the knight&#8217;s beautiful wife became
suddenly ill. The knight loved her
as he loved his own life, and was in great
sorrow for fear that she might die.</p>

<p>Many wise doctors were called to her
bedside, but they could do nothing. They
declared that there was only one thing
that would cure her&mdash;the milk of a lioness.
That could not be obtained because there
were no lions in the country.</p>

<p>The rumor of this strange remedy
spread rapidly through the castle. It
came to the ears of the faithful little page.
He at once sprang to his feet and rushed
out of the hall. An hour later, before
any change had taken place in the lady&#8217;s
condition, the page returned to the castle.</p>

<p>He went directly to the bedside of his
mistress and sat down, flushed and panting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
But in his hand he bore a cup full
of the milk of a lioness, which was given
to the patient at once. In a few moments
the color crept back into the lady&#8217;s pale
cheeks. A new light came into her eyes
and she sank into a sweet sleep. When
she awoke she was fully cured. All her
strength had come back, and she was very
happy.</p>

<p>Then the good knight went to seek the
little page. He poured out to him his
thanks. He could not say enough to
express what he felt for his faithful
servant. He wished to know all about
it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, my sweet, faithful page,&#8221; he
urged, &#8220;how you were able to get this
remedy, which all my wealth could not
procure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My noble master,&#8221; replied the page, &#8220;I
knew that a lioness was lying with her
cubs in an Arabian den, and so I&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arabia!&#8221; exclaimed the knight, interrupting
the page, &#8220;Arabia! Did you find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
your way there and back in one short
hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear master,&#8221; replied the little
page, &#8220;that is the truth.&#8221; And he
fixed his beautiful, truthful eyes on his
master&#8217;s pale, wondering face.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lad, who are you then?&#8221; suddenly
asked the knight, a nameless fear gnawing
at his heart. &#8220;Who are you? Speak;
tell me everything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Master, my noble master, ask not who
I am nor whence I came,&#8221; cried the little
page, sinking down at the knight&#8217;s
feet, and raising his beseeching hands.
&#8220;Do not ask me. Let me remain by your
side, my good master. Remember that no
harm has come to you since I have been
in your service.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My page, stop this pleading and tell
me what I ask. Who are you?&#8221; continued
the knight, paying no attention to
the little page&#8217;s beseeching look.</p>

<p>&#8220;A spirit, O my master, a spirit of light,
who for you and yours left a home in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
realms above. But now I must leave you,
my master. Farewell; farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lad, lad, my sweet lad, leave me not.
Stay with me still,&#8221; cried the knight.
&#8220;Ask what reward you please, but do not
forsake me. Remain, my faithful little
page, for I cannot live without you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have asked me what I am and
whence I came, and have mentioned a reward.
The charm, my dear master, is
broken, and now I must leave you. In
return for the things that I have done for
you so cheerfully and so lovingly, I ask
you to place a silver bell in the midst of
the forest. Its tinkling sound may guide
many weary travelers and help them to
find their way home. Dedicate the bell to
God and to his angelic host, O master;
and now receive my last farewell.&#8221;</p>

<p>The little page suddenly vanished. No
one saw him leave the hall nor pass
through the castle gates, and no trace of
him was ever found. The angel page had
faded from mortal sight and returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his home above. He had gone back to
live with spirits as good and faithful and
pure as himself.</p>

<p>The knight at once had the silver bell
placed in the forest. But he could not
forget his faithful page. He sought for
him everywhere, and when at evening the
silver tones of the little bell rang out in
the quiet air they seemed to him like the
words of an angel, and filled his heart
with restless desire.</p>

<p>The noble knight seemed to lose all interest
in life. His strength began to fail;
his step grew slow and feeble; and one
day when the shades of night were falling
and the first tinkle of the little bell
came to his ear, he softly murmured &#8220;My
page, my faithful little page&#8221;; and he
went to live with the spirit he had learned
to love so well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the high hill above the Rhine still
stand the ruins of an old Castle. Here
Kuno Von Sayne once lived. Kuno was
a very proud young man for he was a
member of a very noble family.</p>

<p>He had fallen in love with the beautiful
daughter of the surly old Lord of Faulkenstein.
At last he succeeded in winning
the love of the maiden, but of her
father he had great fear.</p>

<p>After many months of hoping and fearing,
he decided to go to the old Lord and
ask for his daughter&#8217;s hand. One beautiful
morning he set out on his mission,
to the Castle of Faulkenstein. This Castle
was perched far up on the heights that
rose above a small river.</p>

<p>It was a long journey, and he had almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
lost his courage when he reached the
place. However, he went at once into the
presence of the Lord of Faulkenstein and
boldly made known his wish.</p>

<p>The grim, old Lord looked at him
long and closely, then in tones that were
terrible to poor Kuno spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; he said, &#8220;consider the matter
if you will promise to do one thing for
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without waiting to find out what he
was to do, Kuno eagerly consented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said the Lord of Faulkenstein,
&#8220;you may wed my daughter on condition
that you build a convenient road over the
jagged rock to the village. You are to
ride up that road on your war horse before
sunrise to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Poor Kuno was speechless. Nothing
was to be said, for he knew how impossible
was the task. Many months of hard
labor would scarcely accomplish the great
work.</p>

<p>Sadly he made his way down the rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
again. He had not been able to catch
even a glimpse of the fair Irmangarde, his
beloved, so he sat down upon a rock in the
valley and began to reproach himself for
his stupidity.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was aroused from his
thoughts by a small voice calling to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kuno, Kuno Von Sayne,&#8221; it said.</p>

<p>He looked up and there before him
stood the King of the Gnomes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Despair not,&#8221; said the kindly little
man. &#8220;Myself and my subjects will
gladly help so good a knight; so away to
the inn where you left your steed. Before
sunrise to-morrow morning the road
shall be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the King of the Gnomes waved
his hand. A great mist rose and covered
the hill and valley with its dense vapor.
Thousands of dwarf-like creatures now
sprang out of the ground on all sides.
They began using axes, hammers, and
spades with great good will. All night
long Kuno Von Sayne heard the crashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of great forest trees, and the breaking of
stones. Now and then he heard a loud
rumble like thunder; there was a continual
clatter and crashing throughout the
whole night. At dawn he came from his
room, and was greeted by the inn-keeper.</p>

<p>&#8220;A great storm must have raged over
the valley last night,&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;I
was kept awake all the night by the noise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kuno did not pause to listen to the
man&#8217;s tales, but loudly called for his horse.
He mounted and rode rapidly away to the
foot of the mountain. Far above him
loomed the Castle of Faulkenstein. How
Kuno&#8217;s heart leaped with joy. There, indeed,
was a road leading up to the Castle.
True to his promise, the King of the
Gnomes had built a broad, convenient
road through the forest and over the
rocks. Kuno galloped boldly up, exchanging
smiles with the kindly dwarfs
who peered at him from behind every rock
and tree. From the ramparts of the Castle,
stepped the beautiful Irmangarde.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Kuno dashed over the arched bridge the
dwarfs were just finishing and greeted her
gaily. The dwarfs raised a glad shout of
triumph. The Knight of Faulkenstein
was awakened by the shout. He looked
out, and there, stretching far out from
the Castle, saw the newly built road. He
thought he must still be dreaming, and
rubbed his eyes again and again.</p>

<p>When, however, he saw the beaming
face of Irmangarde and Kuno, he knew
that he had been outwitted. So as the
first sunbeams fell upon the Castle, lighting
up the gladdened heart and blushing
cheeks of the maiden, Kuno claimed her
as his bride. The Lord of Faulkenstein
was proud to accept a man who could do
such wonderful things as Kuno had accomplished
during the night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LORELEI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Count Ludwig</span> was the only son of the
Prince Palatine. He lived with his father
in the castle at Stahleck. The young
count had heard many marvelous tales of
the beautiful Lorelei and he determined to
go in search of her.</p>

<p>One evening he stole from his father&#8217;s
castle to sail down the Rhine. He hoped
to catch a glimpse of the Siren Lorelei.
The stars were twinkling softly overhead,
and the bark slowly drifted down the river.
Darker and darker grew the waters as
the bed of the Rhine grew narrower. But
the young count did not notice this. His
eyes were fixed on the rocks far above,
where he hoped to see the beautiful nymph.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw a shimmer of white
drapery and golden hair. At the same
time he heard the faint, sweet sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
an alluring song. As he drew nearer, the
melody became more distinct. The moonbeams
fell upon the maiden and seemed
to make her even more beautiful. She
bent over the rocky ledge and beckoned
him to draw nearer.</p>

<p>The count and boatman were spellbound
by the vision above them, and they
paid no heed to the vessel. Suddenly the
boat struck against the rocks and went to
pieces. The men struggled against the
swift current, and all escaped except the
young count. Him the Lorelei took
down to her magic palace below the river
to be her lover forever. Many different
stories about the young count&#8217;s fate were
related by the men who escaped.</p>

<p>The Prince Palatine was deeply grieved
over his only son&#8217;s death. He blamed the
beautiful Lorelei and longed for revenge.
Finally he sent for one of his greatest
warriors.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to capture this wicked creature
who has caused so much woe,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
said. &#8220;Take a band of armed men and
post them at once all around the rock, so
that the nymph cannot escape.&#8221;</p>

<p>The great warrior did as he was commanded.
At the head of a band of armed
men he climbed noiselessly up the moonlit
cliff and presented himself before the
charming Lorelei. There she sat, as
usual, combing her golden hair and crooning
her matchless song. The men
hemmed her in on all sides. They left no
mode of escape except by the steep descent
to the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;We command you to surrender,&#8221; said
the captain of the band.</p>

<p>The nymph made no reply, but gracefully
waved her white hands. The grim
old warriors suddenly felt as if rooted to
the spot. They could neither move nor
speak.</p>

<p>There they stood motionless with dilated
eyes fixed upon the Lorelei. They
saw her remove all of her jewels and drop
them one by one into the Rhine beneath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
her feet. Then she whirled about in a
mystic spell, chanting her magic tunes.
They could understand nothing of it except
now and then a word about white-maned
steeds and pearl shell chariots.</p>

<p>When the song and dance were ended,
the waters of the Rhine began to seethe
and bubble. Higher and higher they
rose, until they reached the top of the
cliff.</p>

<p>The petrified warriors felt the cold tide
surge about their feet. Suddenly they
saw a great white-crested wave rolling
rapidly toward them. In its green depths
they beheld a chariot drawn by white-maned
steeds. Into this car the Lorelei
sprang and quickly vanished over the edge
of the cliff into the river.</p>

<p>In a few moments the angry waters had
sunk to their usual level. The brave warriors
discovered that they could move
once more. They rubbed their eyes and
looked about them. No trace of the sudden
rise except the water drops along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
face of the cliff could be seen. These
shone in the moonlight like diamonds.</p>

<p>The Lorelei has never since then appeared
on the cliff. But boatmen have
often heard the faint sweet echo of her alluring
song, wafted toward them on the
summer breeze at midnight. It is said
that she remains in her beautiful palace
and gardens below the green Rhine, enjoying
the companionship of her earthly
lover.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SUNKEN CITY</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was once, we are told, a fine
tract of land where now roll the waves of
the Zuyder Zee. On the very spot where
now the fishermen anchor their boats and
fish, there stood a beautiful city. It was
protected from the sea by great dykes.</p>

<p>The name of the city was Stavoren, and
the people who lived there were very
wealthy. Some of them were so wealthy
that they laid their great halls with floors
of gold and silver. But in spite of their
wealth they were selfish, thoughtless, and
hard hearted. For the poor people they
cared nothing.</p>

<p>The richest person among them was a
maiden lady. She had palaces, farms,
ships and counting-houses&mdash;everything
that one could desire. But she thought
of nothing except how she might increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
her store. With this in mind she one day
summoned the captain of her largest vessel.</p>

<p>When he came she bade him sail away
to procure a cargo of the most precious
things of earth, and to return within the
year. Not knowing exactly what she
wished, the captain questioned her, but
she simply repeated her order and sent
him away at once.</p>

<p>The captain set sail from Stavoren
without knowing where he was going.
After leaving the harbor he called his officers
together and asked their advice.
Each had a different opinion as to what
were the most precious things of earth.</p>

<p>The captain was plunged into greater
doubt than ever. He thought over the
question for many long hours, smoking
his pipe and scratching his head. At last
he said to himself that nothing could be
more precious than wheat, which is the
staff of life.</p>

<p>Accordingly he purchased a cargo of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
grain, and returned happily to his native
town, arriving long before the year had
passed. The haughty lady had in the
meantime told all her friends that her vessel
had gone in search of the most precious
thing of earth. She would not tell
her closest friend what that most precious
thing might be. So everybody was very
curious.</p>

<p>When one day her captain appeared
suddenly before her and told her that he
had brought a cargo of wheat, her pride
vanished. She flew into a terrible rage
and commanded that every kernel be cast
into the sea at once. The captain was
shocked at this order and plead with her
to allow him to give the wheat to the poor.
She repeated her command.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will come down to the port myself,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;to make sure that every kernel
is cast into the sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain made his way sadly back
to his vessel. As he did so he met several
beggars by the way and told them that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
cargo of wheat was to be cast into the
sea. By the time the lady reached the
dock the poor had gathered there from all
parts of the city, hoping to secure some of
the grain.</p>

<p>When the lady approached, many imploring
hands were extended toward her,
but all was in vain. Angry and proud,
she made the sailors cast all the wheat
into the sea. The captain, powerless to
prevent this sinful waste, looked on in
quiet rage. When the last kernel had
disappeared beneath the water he turned
to his haughty mistress.</p>

<p>&#8220;As surely as there is a God above us,&#8221;
he exclaimed, &#8220;you will be punished for
this sin. The time will come when you,
the wealthiest person in Stavoren, will
long for a few handfuls of this wasted
wheat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The lady listened to his words in
haughty silence. When he had finished,
she took a costly ring from her delicate
hand and cast it into the sea.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>&#8220;When this ring comes back to me,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;I will believe what you say and
fear that I may come to want.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few hours afterward the lady&#8217;s cook
was preparing dinner for her. He was
opening a large fish which had just been
brought from the sea, when to his surprise
his eyes fell upon the costly ring.
He immediately sent it to his proud mistress.
When she recognized it she turned
very pale.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward there came a report
that one of her counting-houses had been
ruined, and another report of disaster
came that same evening. All her counting-houses
were ruined. Her fleet had
been destroyed at sea; her palaces were
burning; and her farms were laid waste
by storms.</p>

<p>In a few hours everything that she had
possessed was stripped from her. The
palace in which she lived burned down
during the night, and she barely escaped
with her life.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Now she was desolate, indeed! The
rich people of the city cared nothing for
her now that her money was all gone.
The poor people whom she had treated
with contempt allowed her to die of hunger
and cold in a miserable shed.</p>

<p>The city of Stavoren did not profit by
the sad end of the haughty lady. The
rich people continued to enjoy life and to
neglect the poor. It did not matter to
them what happened to their wretched fellow
creatures. They, like the haughty
lady, were truly selfish.</p>

<p>As time went on the sand began to increase
in the port, so that it was soon impossible
for ships to come to anchor. It
grew worse and worse. The waves
washed the sand up until a great sand-bar
rose above the waters and all further commerce
was stopped. It was not very long
before the sand bank was covered with
little green blades. The people gazed
upon it in surprise.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the Lady&#8217;s Sand,&#8221; they declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
&#8220;For it is the wheat that she had cast into
the sea that is growing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wheat grew very rapidly, but bore
no fruit. It did not matter to the rich
even if traffic had ceased. They did not
suffer. The poor, however, were greatly
distressed, for they now had nothing to
do. They besought help from the rich,
but their prayers fell upon deaf ears.</p>

<p>Not long afterward a little leak was discovered
in the dyke which protected the
city. Through this the sea water crept
into the city reservoir, spoiling all the
drinking water.</p>

<p>The rich people only laughed, saying
that they would drink champagne, since
water was not to be had. But what were
the poor to do? They crowded around
the gates of the rich, imploring a sup of
beer, but were rudely driven away.</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a good thing,&#8221; said the
rich, &#8220;if these wretched creatures should
actually die. Of what use are they to
themselves or to any one else?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>The rich of Stavoren had had their last
chance to do good. That very same night
when the revelers had returned to sleep,
the sea broke down the weakened dykes.
Bursting in, it covered up the whole town.</p>

<p>Over the spot where Stavoren once
stood the waves now glitter in the bright
sun light or plunge and dash when the
cold winds come sweeping in from the sea.</p>

<p>Boatmen come rowing up from the desolate
little fishing town which now bears
the name of the ancient city. When the
waters are smooth they rest upon their
oars to point out far beneath them the
spires and turrets and palaces of Stavoren.</p>

<p>The streets of the old town as it lies
beneath the waves, once so populous, are
deserted. The market place is empty.
No sound is to be heard except when some
inquiring fish, swimming through the
belfries, strikes one of the bells with his
tail. Then there is heard a sad sound
which seems to be tolling the knell of the
sunken city.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BIRD OF PARADISE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> once lived in the monastery at
Heisterbach a kindly monk, of great learning
and simple manners. He had studied
for many years that he might settle some
doubts that troubled him.</p>

<p>He had observed that people grow tired
of even the best of things. They desire
to behold new scenes, to hear new music,
and to taste new dishes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if it will be so in Heaven,&#8221;
he said to himself. &#8220;Shall we not grow
weary of beauties and joys of Heaven in
the endless flow of ages?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question perplexed him sorely; but
he was unable to answer it to his satisfaction.
Wearied with the doubt, he decided
to put it away from him if possible.
So one beautiful sunny morning in summer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
he turned his steps toward the woods
that stretched away for miles back of the
monastery.</p>

<p>It was such a morning as makes one
glad to be alive. Silvery clouds were
floating like great white ships across the
blue sky. The gentle breeze was playing
among the branches of the trees. Flowers
were blooming and birds were singing
happily everywhere.</p>

<p>Earth seemed to breathe forth peace
and joy for all mankind. Beauty and
blessing were everywhere. Yet, with all
this to gladden him, Alfus was not satisfied.
His heart was not at ease.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas!&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;how all is changed!
The rapture with which I first looked
upon this lovely scene, is gone. The
beauty with which it once greeted me is
no more. Why must it be so?&#8221;</p>

<p>As Alfus was pondering on this thought
he wandered on, paying no attention to the
path he was following. Hour after hour
passed and still he walked on, until finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
he became weary and decided to rest. He
sat down on a mossy bank and began to
look about him.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful spot, and one which
he had never visited before, although he
thought he was familiar with every place
in the forest. The trees were tall and
leafy. The branches stretched out forming
beautiful arches above him. At his
feet were delicate ferns and wild flowers
of many different colors. He heard the
drowsy hum of the bee and saw a beautiful
butterfly flitting about from flower
to flower.</p>

<p>His admiration was awakened. It
seemed as if he saw a new beauty in the
things about him, and he forgot that he
was tired. Suddenly there came to him
the song of a bird which seemed to be the
sweetest he had ever heard. He looked
and saw the bird perched upon a tree
nearby. It seemed to pour forth its song
in one strain of perfect happiness. It
seemed so thrilling and so beautiful that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Alfus could not think it earthly. With
intense delight the monk leaned back
against the mossy bank, listening to the
strain. The song lasted but a moment
and ceased as suddenly as it had begun.
Alfus desired to hear it again. He looked
for the bird, and waited, but it was gone.
Around him all was silence. Even the
breeze seemed to have ceased its rustling
among the leaves of the trees. The monk
slowly rose and began his way back
through the woods to the monastery.</p>

<p>But how everything seemed to have
changed. Could it be that he was in a
part of the woods he had never visited before?
He, too, did not seem to be the
same. His steps were now halting and
slow, and all his body seemed feeble and
stiff. As he looked at his beard he saw
that it was gray.</p>

<p>He walked on in amazement. The
trees seemed to have become much larger
since he had entered the forest. Even the
bushes had grown into tall trees. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wondered if he were dreaming or if he
had lost his mind.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i048.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Slowly and painfully he picked his way
back through the dense forest, and after
several hours of walking came to the open
land. Eagerly he looked up to the monastery,
but that too had changed. It was
older and grayer than before and seemed
to have increased in size. A new portion
had been added, and the entrance gate
was not the same which had stood there
when he left in the morning. Everything
looked older.</p>

<p>What could have happened? He had
been gone but a few hours, yet all the
world had changed. It seemed as if he
were in another century. Alfus passed
his hand across his eyes as if to clear his
sight and anxiously walked on. As he
passed the fountain at the village he saw
some women washing, but they were new
to him; yet he had known every man
woman and child for miles around.
Whence had these strange faces come?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>&#8220;Look,&#8221; cried one of them as the old
man passed by. &#8220;This ancient monk
wears the dress of the order, yet his face
is new to me; I have never seen him before.
Who can he be?&#8221;</p>

<p>To this strange remark Alfus paid no
heed. He only hastened on the faster.
He was beginning to doubt his senses.
He went directly to the gate of the monastery.
But this was much larger than it
had been when he had left. He rang the
bell. The sound was no longer the same.
The silvery peal of the bell he had known
had given place to the harsh clang of a
much larger one.</p>

<p>At length there came a young monk to
open the door. Alfus was amazed. It
was a stranger&mdash;a man whom he had
never seen before. He gazed at him
speechless.</p>

<p>&#8220;What has happened,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Why
are all things so changed? Where is
Brother Antony? Why does he not open
the door as usual?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8220;Brother Antony!&#8221; exclaimed the monk.
&#8220;There is no such person here. I am the
porter, and no one but me has opened this
door for the last twenty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment poor Alfus stood on the
threshold as if petrified. Then he beheld
two monks slowly passing along the
corridor. They, too, were strangers, but
he reached forward and clutched one of
them by the gown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brethren,&#8221; he cried in agony, &#8220;I beseech
you speak. Tell me what has happened.
Only a few hours ago I left the
monastery for a quiet walk in the woods,
and now when I come back, behold, all is
changed. Where is the Abbot? Where
are my companions? Is there no one
here who remembers Alfus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alfus&mdash;Alfus,&#8221; repeated one of the
monks thoughtfully to himself. &#8220;There
has been no one of that name here for a
hundred years. There was once a man
by that name in the monastery, but he disappeared
long ago. I remember hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
about him when I was a small lad, but
whether the story is true or not, I cannot
tell.</p>

<p>&#8220;He went one morning, as was often
his custom, to walk in the forest alone,&#8221;
the monk went on, &#8220;and they never heard
from him afterward. The monks sought
for him throughout the forest day after
day, but no trace of him could be found.
He seemed to have vanished from the
earth. The Abbot thought that God
must have borne him up to Heaven in a
chariot of fire like Elijah. He was a very
holy man, indeed. But all this happened
so long ago, that it may be simply a
story.&#8221;</p>

<p>At these words a sudden light seemed
to shine in the face of poor Alfus. He
sank to his knees and clasped his trembling
hands as if in prayer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now I understand, O God, that a
thousand years are but as a day in thy
sight. A whole century passed while I
held my breath to listen to the song of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the bird&mdash;the bird which sings at the gate
of Paradise. Forgive my doubts, O Lord,
and grant that I may enter into thy rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the monks looked at Alfus they saw
that a great calm had settled upon his
face. A radiant smile played about his
lips. He sank back gently upon a settle
and the wondering monks crowded about
him, but to their astonishment he did not
move, and when they looked more closely
they saw that his pure soul had flown
away to his Heavenly mansion, there to
enjoy endless ages of unchanging happiness.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE BELL OF ATRI</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> olden times there lived in Italy a
kind-hearted king. He was sorry for
any trouble that came to his people, and
did all he could to make them happy. Because
of his goodness the people called
him Good King John.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish all of my people to be just,&#8221;
said the king. &#8220;And I wish every one to
be treated justly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not all of his people were as good as
King John himself. Many did wrongs to
their neighbors. And the neighbors complained
to the good King.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will set up a great bell in the market
place,&#8221; said the King at last. &#8220;If any one
is wronged, let him ring the bell. He
shall have justice.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the King had a large bell set up in
the market place, where any one could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
ring it. Then he appointed a good judge
to right the people&#8217;s wrongs.</p>

<p>Many people rang the bell in the years
that followed. All received justice and
went away happy. The bell was used so
much that the rope was worn away little
by little. At last it became so short that
many people could not reach it. Then
some one fastened a piece of grape vine
to the rope.</p>

<p>Now, there lived in Atri an old Knight.
In his younger days he had loved to hunt,
and had kept many horses and dogs.
Now he could hunt no more, and so sold
all his horses except the one he had liked
best.</p>

<p>It happened that the old Knight began
to think of nothing but money. He
wished to be very rich.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the use of keeping this one
horse?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;He does
nothing but eat and sleep. It costs too
much to keep him. I will turn him out
to look after himself.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>So the faithful old horse was turned
out into the street. It was in the dry, hot
summer, and there was little grass to be
found. The horse wandered about under
the burning sun, getting a bite here and
a bite there.</p>

<p>In his wandering he came finally to the
market place. He saw the vine hanging
to the bell rope.</p>

<p>&#8220;These leaves,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;are better
than nothing, though they are withered.&#8221;</p>

<p>He began to pull at the withered leaves.
The very first pull set the great bell to
ringing loudly. The poor horse was so
hungry that he paid no attention to the
ringing. He kept on eating, and the bell
rang louder and louder.</p>

<p>The judge heard the sounds, and wondered
who was ringing the bell so loudly.
He put on his robe and hurried to the
market place.</p>

<p>He was greatly surprised when he saw
who had rung the bell. He felt sorry for
the poor creature, however.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>&#8220;Even the dumb beast,&#8221; he murmured,
&#8220;shall have justice. This is the horse of
the Knight of Atri.&#8221;</p>

<p>A large crowd of people had gathered
in a few minutes. They told the judge
the story of the old horse. Their stories,
however, did not agree. The judge,
therefore, decided to call the Knight himself.</p>

<p>The heartless old Knight said that the
horse was useless to him, and that he
could not take care of him any longer.
It cost too much money.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he not always do his duty by you?&#8221;
asked the judge. &#8220;Did he ever refuse to
carry you to the hunt, or to bring you
safely home?&#8221;</p>

<p>The old Knight had to confess that the
horse had always been faithful.</p>

<p>&#8220;The law decides, then,&#8221; cried the
judge, &#8220;that you shall provide him shelter
and food as long as he lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this decision all the people clapped
their hands and shouted loudly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>The old Knight ordered his servant to
lead the horse back to the stable. The
people followed, cheering, because even a
dumb animal could get justice.</p>

<p>The fame of the bell of Atri spread
abroad through all Italy.</p>

<p>To-day people know very little about the
other things that Good King John did.
They simply remember him as the king
who set up the bell of justice at Atri.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE POT OF HOT PORRIDGE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the beautiful land of Switzerland is
a little town named Zurich. Not far from
here is the larger city of Strasburg. The
people of Zurich had long looked with
envy on the larger city and wanted to become
a part of it. At last they decided to
send an appeal to the magistrates. This
they did, but the great magistrate of Strasburg
bluntly refused the honor of such a
union.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zurich is of no importance,&#8221; they said,
&#8220;and besides it is too far away to be of
any help in time of need.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the councilors of Zurich heard
the Strasburger&#8217;s answer, they were very
angry, indeed. They even talked of challenging
the great magistrates.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the youngest of the Zurich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
councilors, &#8220;I will make them eat their
words. I pledge you my honor that I
shall bring you a different answer before
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other councilors were glad to be
relieved of the matter, so they agreed and
returned leisurely to their dwellings. The
youngest councilor went home in a great
hurry. He went at once to the kitchen
and selected the biggest pot there.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with that?&#8221;
asked his wife.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will see,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Fill it with
as much oatmeal as it will contain and
cook it as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>

<p>His wife wondered much at this strange
command, but she bade her servants build
a roaring fire. This they did and soon
the great pot of oatmeal was cooking.
Then such a time as they had stirring the
oatmeal to keep it from burning.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the youngest councilor
ran down to the quay and prepared the
swiftest vessel. He collected a number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
of the best oarsmen and when all was
ready, bade two of them accompany him
home.</p>

<p>He sprang breathless into the kitchen.
The oatmeal was ready.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come boys,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;lift the vessel
from the fire and run down to the boat
with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He followed them closely and saw it
placed in the boat. Then, turning to the
men, he exclaimed,</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, lads, row with all your might.
We are bound to prove to those stupid old
Strasburgers that we are near enough to
serve them a hot supper in case of need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Aroused by these words, the youths
bent to the oars. The vessel shot down
the Simwat, Aar, and Rhine, leaving
town, village, and farms in its wake.
Never did it stop once till it reached the
quay at Strasburg.</p>

<p>The councilor sprang ashore and bade
the two youths follow with the huge pot.
He strode into the council hall and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
them set it before the assembled magistrates.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, Zurich sends you a warm
answer to your cold refusal,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>With open mouths the Strasburgers
gazed at the still steaming pot. When
the young Zuricher explained how it got
there they laughed heartily. They were
so amused with the wit and promptitude
of their neighbors that they voted at once
to grant their request.</p>

<p>The papers for the alliance were signed
and sealed. Then the great magistrates
called for spoons and ate every bit of the
oatmeal. They called it excellent, and it
proved hot enough to burn more than one
councilor&#8217;s mouth.</p>

<p>Ever since then this huge iron pot has
been known as the &#8220;pot of alliance.&#8221; It
has been carefully kept in the town hall
of Strasburg, where it can still be seen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SILVER BELL</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the ancient city of Speyer, there
were in olden times two great bells. Neither
one of these was ever rung by human
hands, but it is said that an angel came
down from Heaven at night to ring one
of these bells whenever a person died.</p>

<p>One of the bells was of iron. It was
rung whenever the soul of a sinful person
took its flight. The other bell was of pure
silver. It had been placed in the tower
by a baron. He had erected it with the
understanding that it should never be
rung until there came a person who really
loved his fellow men.</p>

<p>When this bell was erected it was muffled
by many bands, so that it could give
forth no sound until it had been placed
carefully in the tower.</p>

<p>It was agreed also, that if no person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
who truly loved his fellow men should be
found within the space of thirty-three
years, the bell should forever remain silent.
It was to be a witness against the
unkindness of men.</p>

<p>The thirty-three years were now almost
completed, and no one had been found in
the whole country of whom it could be
said that he unselfishly loved his fellows.
Many kind deeds had been done; many
brave and noble services had been performed;
but when examined closely, there
always seemed to be some selfish motive
behind them.</p>

<p>The people of the valley had looked
longingly day after day at this bell, and
had hoped and prayed that some one
might appear for whom the bell could be
rung. All longed to hear its silver
sound. It was said to give forth the most
enchanting music. But the summers and
winters came and went.</p>

<p>The young people who had seen the bell
placed in the tower had grown old. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
had waited and waited, and hope began to
sink in their hearts. They began to think
that they should never hear the sound of
the silver bell.</p>

<p>An awful pestilence broke out in the
land. There was no one who knew how
to save the wretched people. Gloom settled
down over the whole city. It seemed
to be threatened with utter destruction.</p>

<p>Again there were deeds of mercy done;
again hearts bled with sympathy for their
fellows; again people strove to find out
someone who was truly unselfish in his
charity. But upon examination it was
found that people pitied their friends, and
neglected their enemies. They wept for
those near them, but were thoughtless of
those whom they did not know. Fathers
and mothers were brave to protect their
own children, but careless about the children
of other people. So, though there
were many noble deeds done, it was found
that they were not the result of a deep
love for mankind in general.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>During all this time the iron bell rang
almost continually. It rang by day, and
it rang by night, until hope and cheerfulness
were gone, and despair and fear settled
down upon every household.</p>

<p>The King of this land was a handsome
youth, who had just come to the throne.
He had always had everything that his
heart could desire; and was not trained to
bear hardships or to sympathize with the
suffering of others. No one hoped to
find comfort in him, or relief from despair.</p>

<p>At night, however, when the city was
sunk to its fitful rest, this young king
knelt in prayer for the poor and the
wretched, and then rose to answer his
prayer by his own hand. With food and
clothes he loaded his horse and went forth
alone through the city, disguised as a
peasant.</p>

<p>Night after night he passed through
the dark and wretched streets, carrying
his treasures to distribute among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
poor. From evening until daybreak he
labored alone to relieve the suffering of
his people. Then as the last shadows
fled he returned to his palace gate.</p>

<p>The people at last began to hope that a
truly unselfish soul had appeared. They
had, however, very little time to think of
this matter or of the silver bell because of
their wretchedness. The thought, however,
that there was some one to care for
them was a source of comfort to many.
Joy was awakened in their hearts, and joy
brought strength to them, until at last people
returned to forge and field to perform
their usual labors.</p>

<p>The man, however, who had come to
them in their need had remained concealed.
No one had found out or even
suspected who he was. Many thought
that an angel had come to them. Many
others believed that it was the work of
some good soul, and hoped to find out who
it was. They began to believe that the
silver bell might yet be rung.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>At last they went to the king and besought
him to issue a proclamation, in
order that he might find out the person
who had bestowed so many bounties upon
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; they said, &#8220;a truly unselfish
soul has been among us, although we
know not who he is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My good people,&#8221; replied the king, &#8220;be
contented. Should it not be enough that
God has sent his servant to you in the
hour of your need?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This king,&#8221; they murmured, &#8220;in his
wealth and power, enjoying the blessings
of youth, has not known what we have
suffered, and therefore cannot appreciate
our gratitude. While we were starving
in our hovels, he was sitting in his castle,
quaffing wine. We can expect nothing
from him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At least,&#8221; clamored others, &#8220;let the
great bell be rung, for the thirty-three
years are now almost over. We shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
never hear its notes of gladness unless it
be rung today.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied the king still, &#8220;but if you
will, go and pray that the Lord may send
His angel down to ring the bell, if in His
perfect knowledge he sees a being who is
worthy of the honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night many people waited before
the church, praying that God in His goodness
might send a spirit from on high to
ring the silver bell.</p>

<p>The night slowly passed away, and lo,
the sun&#8217;s first rays were just about to
come up over the mountains. Suddenly
the sun seemed to pause; the dusk continued.
Then there came, as it were, a
splendor from the clouds, the brightness
of which rested on the church and its
tower. The waiting multitude all looked
up in astonishment. The bell began to
peal. It sent forth its angelic notes&mdash;notes
such as no human being had ever
heard before. The waiting people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
enraptured. It seemed to them as if all
the Heavenly Host were singing for joy.</p>

<p>The song of the bell was of peace and
good will toward men. The sounds
echoed and re-echoed among the mountains,
and were borne away to the farthest
valleys.</p>

<p>Just as the first light of the sun peeped
up over the horizon, the splendors faded
from the tower and in their stead there
appeared the figure of a man clad in light.
Across the tower there seemed to be a row
of letters. The people looked up and
read: &#8220;Behold, the man who loved truly
his fellow men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then everyone fell to his knees, for
there stood the figure of their King.
Their hearts died within them, when they
remembered how harshly they had spoken
of him: but they rejoiced at the same time
to know that it was he. They all rose up
and went in haste to honor him whom
they had scorned of late.</p>

<p>When they reached the palace gate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
however, they were not permitted to enter.
The angel who had rung the bell had entered
the palace before them, and had
taken away with him the imperial soul
that had unselfishly loved his fellow men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE TWO BAKER BOYS</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many,</span> many years ago the people in
Germany lived in little towns with high
walls around them. They built walls
around their towns because they had
quarrels with other towns. The walls
protected them against their enemies.</p>

<p>Sometimes people kept bee-hives on the
high walls. The bees could fly away into
the fields outside and gather honey.
There were not many flowers inside the
city to get honey from.</p>

<p>One morning two baker boys were
hungry. They had to get up very early.
Some fine rolls had just been taken from
the oven. The boys thought it would be
fine to have some rolls and honey.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up on the walls and get some
honey out of one of the hives,&#8221; said
John.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;But the bees will sting us,&#8221; answered
James. &#8220;Besides the watchman on the
walls might see us. Then we would be in
trouble of another kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>John, however, persuaded James to go.
The two boys stole out of the shop, and
ran across the street.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they were creeping
up the stairs that led to the top of the
wall.</p>

<p>There was no watchman to be seen.
He had gotten sleepy probably, and had
gone somewhere to rest. But there was
a noise coming from somewhere.</p>

<p>The boys listened, but all was quiet
again. They made their way quietly
along the wall till they came to the hives.</p>

<p>Then they covered their faces and got
ready to rob the bees of their treasure.
John was just lifting the top from one of
the hives, when he heard another strange
noise. He dropped the hive hurriedly.</p>

<p>The noise seemed to come from the outside
of the wall. The boys looked over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and saw a small army. It was the people
of Linz, who had come to attack the town.</p>

<p>Both boys were terribly frightened at
first. They saw, however, that something
must be done to save the town.</p>

<p>&#8220;James,&#8221; said John, &#8220;you run yonder
and ring the bell. I will tumble the bee-hives
down on their heads.&#8221;</p>

<p>James did as he was told. John pushed
a hive over the wall. It fell on the
leader&#8217;s head and went to pieces. The
bees were angry at being disturbed in this
way. They flew at the men and stung
their hands and faces, so that they were
glad to run away.</p>

<p>Another bee-hive came tumbling down
and then another. And the angry bees
put the whole army to flight.</p>

<p>By this time the bell had called the
people out to defend the town. But the
army had already departed. The two
boys and the bees had saved the town.</p>

<p>The boys were not punished. Instead
the people praised them for their wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
acts. It was decided to erect a monument
in their honor.</p>

<p>One of the boys afterwards became
mayor of the city. The other was long
known as the most famous baker of his
time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE EMPEROR&#8217;S WOOING</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> little town of Caub is very old.
Above it in olden days rose the Castle of
Gutenfels. Here many years ago lived
Philip, Count of Faulkenstein and his only
sister, Guda. This brother and sister
were orphans, and lived together there
happily.</p>

<p>Many suitors had come to seek the hand
of the beautiful Guda, but she was happy
in her brother&#8217;s love and wished no other.
Often Philip urged her to choose a husband
from among the many wooers.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear sister,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the time
may come when I shall have to leave you.
War may break out at any time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no desire for any love or protection
except yours, my dear Philip. I have
never seen anyone as yet who has made
me wish to leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>Count Philip and Guda used to be a great
deal together; where one went the other
went, too. So when the great tournament
was held at Cologne they set out together
to see it. The tournament was
attended by a large number of knights.
One of them seemed to be greatly attracted
by Guda&#8217;s beauty. He had won
all the prizes in the contest, and yet remained
unknown to everyone except the
bishop.</p>

<p>The manners and conversation of the
unknown knight pleased everyone, and
especially the Count of Faulkenstein. So
much was he charmed by the bearing of
the victorious knight that he invited him
to visit his castle at Gutenfels. This invitation
the knight eagerly accepted.</p>

<p>Philip and Guda welcomed him warmly
and were very much delighted with their
new friend. The stranger&#8217;s admiration
for Guda became more and more plain;
day by day he grew fonder of the beautiful
girl.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>&#8220;I should delight in lingering here forever,&#8221;
he said at last.</p>

<p>This, however, could not be, for there
was a great war in Germany. The Emperor
had died leaving no heir, so there
were many who claimed the right to the
throne. Richard of Cornwall had most
supporters. Many of the nobles had declared
for him, and were ready to take up
arms in his behalf.</p>

<p>Among those who departed for the war
was Philip Faulkenstein. He set out,
leaving behind him his guest, who promised
to follow within three days, to fight
by his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Before I go,&#8221; he declared, &#8220;I must receive
a certain message.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two days later the message came. In
the meantime the knight had won Guda&#8217;s
love and her promise to wait for him
until his return. So Guda was left alone
in the Castle of Gutenfels. Many hours
she spent thinking about her absent lover
and wishing for his return.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>At last the war was ended and her
brother came back, yet Guda was not
happy. She began to grow anxious, for
she had received no tidings from her
knight.</p>

<p>Weeks passed by. The anxious days
stole the color from her cheeks. At last
she withdrew to her chamber in sorrow,
for she was sure that her knight was dead.
She did not even wish to appear when the
new Emperor, Richard of Cornwall came
to visit her brother at the castle.</p>

<p>When the Imperial Guest came he was
clad from head to foot in heavy armor.
He refused even to raise his vizor.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;on a personal
errand. I have often heard of the great
beauty of your sister Guda and I wish to
make her Empress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Philip was overjoyed at the prospect of
such a happy marriage for his sister.
Joyfully he bore the Emperor&#8217;s offer to
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas, my brother,&#8221; she said, &#8220;it is impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
for me to accept the Emperor&#8217;s
love; mine belongs to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>When her reply was carried to the
Emperor, he listened calmly, without the
least sign of displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;May I,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have the pleasure of
beholding the lady? Perhaps I may be
able to win a more favorable answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>With vizor still lowered, and speaking
in muffled tones, the Emperor addressed
Guda.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, fair lady, do you refuse the suit
of your Emperor? Forget your former
lover; he is either dead or faithless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sire,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;you do me the
greatest honor in the world, yet can I not
accept it. I must remain true to him to
whom I have given my love. He may be
dead, but I am sure he is not faithless.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this the Emperor threw up his vizor
and clasped Guda in his arms. As she
looked into his bright face, she recognized
him who had won her love as a simple
knight.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i084.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>She no longer refused to listen to his
suit. Soon afterward she married Richard
Cornwall and became Empress of
Germany.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE MAGIC RING</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span> was king of France and
emperor of Germany. He had married a
beautiful eastern princess, whose name
was Frastrada. His love for her was so
great that his only thought was to give
her happiness. All wondered at his devotion,
but none suspected the cause.</p>

<p>Frastrada had a wonderful gold ring.
On it were inscribed mystic signs.
Frastrada wore the ring continually, and
it was this magic talisman that had
worked such a charm.</p>

<p>But the new queen did not long enjoy
her power. A great illness overtook her.
During this time she thought often of the
magic treasure and feared it would pass
into other hands. So she slipped the ring
from her finger into her mouth and quietly
breathed her last.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>The Emperor was quite overcome with
grief. He refused to have the queen
taken to the cathedral, but stayed constantly
by her side.</p>

<p>In vain the councilors and courtiers
plead with him. In vain Turpin, the
prime minister, told him that the people
had need of him. He refused to leave the
chamber where the queen lay, or to partake
of food. At last he fell asleep at his
post.</p>

<p>Turpin felt convinced that the queen
possessed some charm, so he stole noiselessly
to her bedside. After some time he
found the ring. He concealed it in his
own clothing, and sat down to wait for
Charlemagne to awaken.</p>

<p>Soon the Emperor opened his eyes.
He turned from the queen with a shudder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turpin, my faithful friend!&#8221; he cried,
as he threw himself in the arms of the
prime minister. &#8220;Your presence is like
balm to my wounded heart! You shall
remain by my side forever!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>From that time on, Turpin was forced
to accompany Charlemagne wherever he
went. The courtiers wondered at Turpin&#8217;s
influence. Many of them were quite
jealous. As for poor Turpin, he was
wearied beyond all expression. He could
find no rest either by night or by day.
Vainly he sought for some plan by which
he might rid himself of the troublesome
gem.</p>

<p>At length it happened that Charlemagne
and Turpin set out from the palace
of Ingelheim on a journey to the north.
They camped one night in a great forest.
While his master lay asleep Turpin left
the camp and wandered out into the
moonlight alone. Not once before, since
he had found the ring, had he been free
from the Emperor.</p>

<p>His heart swelled with a feeling of relief
as he plunged into the pathless forest.
On and on he wandered, trying to think
of some way to rid himself of the troublesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
ring. Like Frastrada, he did not
want anyone else to come into possession
of it and thus get such an influence over
the Emperor.</p>

<p>After long wandering he found himself
at the opening of a beautiful glade. Before
him lay a quiet pool embosomed in
the dark woods. The moonlight flooded
the retired spot and shone like silver over
the deep and quiet waters.</p>

<p>Turpin was lost in admiration. He sat
down on a stone and feasted his eyes in
silence on the peaceful beauty of the
scene. Soon the thought of the magic
ring came to disturb his happiness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall I do with it?&#8221; he groaned.</p>

<p>He drew it from its hiding place in his
breast and examined it closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;what is this I
see?&#8221;</p>

<p>He noticed by the pale light of the moon
that the ring bore something else beside
the strange signs. On it was the image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of a tiny swan. He looked at it in amazement;
for he had never seen the swan before.</p>

<p>He started up, then stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked himself. &#8220;Those
deep and quiet waters would soon close
over and conceal the ring forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later the jewel flashed beneath
the rays of the moon. A slight
splash was borne along by the night air.
Ever widening ripples broke the mirror-like
surface of the pool. In the distance
a snowy swan appeared sailing with
stately calm over the ruffled waters.</p>

<p>Delighted to be rid of the hateful jewel,
Turpin now made his way back to the
tent. Charlemagne was awake and
greeted him as in the days of old. The
charm was broken.</p>

<p>The morning sun rose bright and clear.
The Emperor, however, became restless.
He proposed that they tarry in the spot
another day and hunt in the forest. Turpin
agreed, and soon the forest echoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
were awakened by the clangor of the
hunting horns.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i092.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A royal stag was started from covert.
Closely the huntsmen and hounds followed
it. At last, panting and exhausted,
it was brought to bay in a remote glade,&mdash;the
very place which Turpin had visited
the night before.</p>

<p>Charlemagne had been foremost in the
chase all the morning. Now he sat motionless
in his saddle, gazing in spellbound
admiration at the sunny stretch of
water. He observed the reflection of the
blue sky, and the swans gliding over its
smooth surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! how beautiful!&#8221; he exclaimed.
&#8220;I would fain linger here forever.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he dismounted and threw himself
down upon the smooth grass by the edge
of the pool. There he remained in
dreamy content all day long.</p>

<p>At last the shadows began to lengthen.
The glow of the setting sun was reflected
in the miniature lake. Charlemagne was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
so enchanted with the scene that he vowed
to build a castle there. The vow was
kept, and the structure that arose was the
beginning of Charlemagne&#8217;s capital and
favorite city, Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>When many years had passed, death
came to the great Emperor. He was laid
at rest in the cathedral vault, not far from
the spot he loved so well.</p>

<p>Strangers visiting Aix-la-Chapelle are
told not to visit the magic pool by moonlight.
At the mystic hour when Turpin
dropped the ring into the quiet waters,
the spell recovers all its former powers.
Accordingly, should any one visit it at
that time, his longing heart would always
lead him back to the charmed spot, however
far away he might be wandering in
the wide world.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHARLEMAGNE&#8217;S GENEROSITY</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Charlemagne</span> had had a new palace
built for him in a beautiful spot near the
Rhine. When it was completed he went
to visit it. The first night that he slept
in the palace, a very strange incident occurred.
An angel came and stood by his
bedside.</p>

<p>&#8220;Arise,&#8221; it seemed to say to him,
&#8220;arise, go forth and enter secretly the
house of Arnot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Emperor was so astonished at this
command that he did not know what to
do. He could scarcely believe that such
an order could come from an angel, so
he did not move, but the command was
repeated, and then repeated again.</p>

<p>When the angel commanded him the
third time to go and enter secretly the
house of Arnot, he arose, went quietly to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
his stable, saddled his horse himself, and
rode silently out into the darkness, in the
direction of the home of Arnot, one of his
most trusted ministers.</p>

<p>As he was going along the dark way
thoughtfully, he heard someone approaching,
and he soon perceived that it was a
knight clad in dark armor. Charlemagne
could think of no good mission upon which
a man could be riding at such an hour; so
he challenged the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whither goest thou, and upon what
mission at this hour of the night?&#8221; he demanded.</p>

<p>The knight did not answer, but put
spurs to his horse and charged upon the
Emperor. Seeing this movement, the Emperor
did likewise, and the two met with
a violent shock. Both were unhorsed,
and in the hand to hand conflict which
followed, the Emperor got the better of
the unknown knight and brought him to
the ground. With his sword at the
throat of the knight he demanded his name.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i098.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;I am Elbegast,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;a notorious
robber knight, and have committed
many a bold deed. Thou art the first that
has had power to overcome me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Arise,&#8221; said the Emperor, without
telling who he was, &#8220;and come with me.
I am on a mission like thine own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without hesitating, the robber knight
joined his conqueror.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have vowed,&#8221; said the Emperor, &#8220;not
to return home until I have broken into
the house of the Emperor&#8217;s most trusted
minister.&#8221; So saying, he led the way to
the house of Arnot.</p>

<p>Elbegast was not long in gaining entrance.
Bidding his companion wait for
him outside, he stole noiselessly into the
house.</p>

<p>As he approached the bed room of the
minister, the sound of voices in earnest
conversation came to his ears. He listened,
and heard the minister disclose to
his wife a plan for the murder of the Emperor
on the following day.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>Forgetting the purpose for which he
had come to the house, the knight made
his way hastily back to his companion and
besought him to go at once to Charlemagne
and inform him of the coming
danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, myself would gladly go to save the
Emperor&#8217;s life, but I would surely get into
trouble, because of my many evil deeds,
and more than likely the Emperor would
not believe me. But whatever I have
done, I hold great admiration for the man
who has never been conquered in battle,
and who has always worked for the good
of his people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Charlemagne and Elbegast parted,
one returning to his stronghold in the
mountains and the other retracing his
steps slowly and thoughtfully to his palace.</p>

<p>On the morrow the ministers attempted
to carry out the plot which they had
formed against the Emperor; but their
plans were thwarted. Charlemagne took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
all of them into custody and they confessed
their plot against him.</p>

<p>Charlemagne, however, was of a
noble and generous nature, and pardoned
all those who had conspired against him.
This generosity on his part made them so
ashamed of their plot that they vowed to
serve him ever afterward with all true
loyalty. And it is said that every one of
them kept his promise faithfully.</p>

<p>Charlemagne then set his mind upon
reforming Elbegast, and sent a messenger
to him, requesting him to come to the
palace.</p>

<p>&#8220;I, Charlemagne, Emperor of Germany,&#8221;
his message ran, &#8220;would speak
privately with Elbegast, the robber
knight, and promise him safe conduct to
and from the castle.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elbegast came to the palace in response
to the request of Charlemagne, and was
admitted to the private council chamber.
Soon a man entered, clad in armor; and
Elbegast recognized the knight who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
been his companion on the adventure to
the house of Arnot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elbegast,&#8221; said Charlemagne, &#8220;you
recognize me and yet you do not know
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Charlemagne raised his visor, and
the knight saw that he was standing in
the presence of the Emperor.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have done me,&#8221; went on the Emperor,
&#8220;faithful duty, and I am ever in
need of faithful servants, and offer you
a place among my retainers. A man of
your courage and skill is worthy of a place
in the Emperor&#8217;s service.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elbegast was so moved that he could
scarcely speak. Charlemagne was the
only man who had ever been able to disarm
him, and he therefore admired him
greatly. More than this, the kindness of
the Emperor appealed to him. Accordingly
he willingly forsook his evil way
of life and became a devoted follower of
the Emperor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SILVER BRIDGE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a spot on the Rhine near
the little hamlet of Kempten that Charlemagne,
the great Emperor, always loved.
There the sun seemed ever to shine more
brightly than elsewhere; there the air was
balmiest; and there the quiet and peacefulness
always calmed his spirit, and filled
it with joy.</p>

<p>To this place he seemed always to come
when he was worried with matters of
state. When he returned from a journey
or a war, he always paid his first visit to
this lovely spot.</p>

<p>All his life long, this was the favorite
spot of the great Emperor. He loved to
see it by daylight, and he loved it by moonlight.
Often did he wander there at
night, when all the rest of the world was
asleep. The green hills, the vineclad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
slopes, and the pleasant glades were more
soothing to him than sleep.</p>

<p>He even desired to be buried in this
place, but his people would not have it so;
and the great man was buried in state in
the beautiful cathedral that he had built
at Aix-la-Chapelle.</p>

<p>But even after death his spirit longed
to visit the spot that had brought so much
peace into his life. It is said that his
spirit visits the place yearly in the late
summer time, even to this day.</p>

<p>On the most beautiful moonlight night
of all the year, people say, Charlemagne
leaves his tomb in the great cathedral and
comes to this quiet valley of the Rhine.
He comes not to do harm, nor simply to
rest and enjoy the place. His purpose is
to bless the spot which was such a blessing
to him during his life.</p>

<p>On the nights when Charlemagne&#8217;s
spirit visits the place, the silvery moonbeams
may be seen to make a fairy bridge
across the river. On this bridge the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
monarch&#8217;s spirit passes across the Rhine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i106.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>He glides back and forth, bestowing his
blessing on everything in the neighborhood.
Every little village, every cottage,
every hill and valley, the vineyards, the
shore, and the great peaceful river itself&mdash;all
receive his blessing.</p>

<p>Last of all he visits the palace which he
built here and called Ingelheim, or Angel&#8217;s
Home. From here he returns to his rest
again.</p>

<p>The people in this little valley are said
to be more prosperous than those of any
other locality along the Rhine. They are
also more happy and more healthy.
Their vineyards are always richly laden
with beautiful clusters of grapes.</p>

<p>If at any time their vineyards do not
bear, the people know that for some mysterious
reason the spirit of Charlemagne
failed to pay the yearly visit. They look
forward, however, to the coming year,
knowing that their harvest will be greater
than ever.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>The great spirit of the Emperor never
fails them two years together. So century
after century Charlemagne has bestowed
his blessing on this country that
he loved. On moonlight nights the people
along the river will point out to you
the silver bridge on which he passes back
and forth over the river visiting blessing
upon everyone.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE PET RAVEN</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> the gate of the Castle of Stolzenfels
is the figure of a Raven. It has been
there for several hundred years. It was
placed there in gratitude for the help a
pet raven had rendered the Princess at a
time when she was in great danger.</p>

<p>Othmar and Williswind were brother
and sister. Since the death of their parents
they had lived together in the beautiful
castle, and had grown to love each
other dearly. They were always together.</p>

<p>The time came when war broke out,
and Othmar was called away. His going
grieved Williswind sorely. Now she
would have no one but the servants with
her in the great Castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear brother,&#8221; she exclaimed,
&#8220;what shall I do without you?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>&#8220;Sister mine,&#8221; replied Othmar, &#8220;I
grieve to leave you thus alone, but you
know it is impossible for me to do otherwise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Othmar took with him all the able bodied
men. Only the old men, women and
children were left at home to protect his
sister.</p>

<p>In those days many lawless robber
knights roamed through the forests, doing
whatever pleased them. Afraid of
these, Williswind ordered that the Castle
gates should be kept closed all the time.</p>

<p>One evening as she sat in the great hall
of the Castle with her servants about her,
a trumpet sounded at the gate. The
women stopped their spinning, and the
men ceased their polishing of arms and
armor. The Warder entered announcing
that there was a pilgrim at the gate
begging for shelter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Admit him at once,&#8221; said Williswind.</p>

<p>In a few moments the Warder returned,
accompanied by the pilgrim.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8220;Be welcome to our cheer, stranger.
Such as we have we give freely,&#8221; said
Williswind.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thanks, fair lady, for your kindness,&#8221;
replied the stranger, glancing about the
room.</p>

<p>The pilgrim was clad in worn garments,
yet did not seem like a beggar. At
times cruelty and cunning appeared in his
face. Secretly he looked about as if to
examine every part of the castle. His
strange manner caused Williswind great
uneasiness. The thought came to her
that he might possibly be a robber knight
in disguise.</p>

<p>In the morning, however, the pilgrim
departed peaceably, and the young princess
felt calm once more. The days
passed quietly by and Williswind began
to look forward to her brother&#8217;s return.
One morning the pilgrim suddenly returned,
but not this time in pilgrims garments.
He was clad in full armor, and
came with a large number of followers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8220;I come,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to demand the hand
of the Princess Williswind in marriage,
and if she denies me I will take her by
force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I beseech you,&#8221; replied Williswind,
&#8220;depart and leave me in peace. I have
love for none but my brother, and desire
only to be left here with my servants to
await quietly his return.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the evil knight only repeated his
demand, saying that he would return in
three days for an answer. If at the end
of that time Williswind did not consent
freely, he would take the Castle by force
and carry her away.</p>

<p>What was to be done? Her brother
was too far away to come to her aid. She
decided, however, to send a message to
him, asking him to come at once.</p>

<p>Knowing that it would be unsafe for
the princess to remain in the Castle the
old Warder persuaded Williswind to set
out for a Convent, which was not many
miles away.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i114.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>The robber knight, however, had left
spies all about the castle and the princess
had not gone very far with her followers,
when they were overtaken by the knight
himself.</p>

<p>The servants with Williswind fought
bravely, but they were soon overcome.
The bold knight carried Williswind and
her maid off to a lonely tower in the
woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here I shall leave you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but
I will return in three days to receive your
answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he locked the heavy door, and left
them alone. The two captives looked
about for means of escape, but they found
only thick walls and heavily barred doors
and windows. All about them was nothing
but wilderness, so they could expect
aid from no passerby. Escape was hopeless.</p>

<p>They looked about the tower for food
and water, but none was to be found.
The unhappy girls sat and waited anxiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
They looked through the barred
windows. The hours seemed days. Suddenly
Williswind gave a cry of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, look,&#8221; she said, &#8220;yonder is my pet
raven.&#8221;</p>

<p>She whistled to the raven. It recognized
her voice and came at once. She
and Othmar had spent many happy hours
together, teaching the raven to do various
things. Among other things, it had
learned to bring berries.</p>

<p>The bird at once seemed to understand
everything, and went out into the woods.
Soon it returned with a few berries.
Back and forth it went during the whole
day, bringing berries to the two hungry
girls. The next day and the day after,
it kept them supplied with this kind of
food.</p>

<p>On the third day the robber knight reappeared.
He felt sure that Williswind
would by this time be ready to agree to
accept him, but his hope was in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
The food which the bird had brought had
increased her courage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for all the wealth of India,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;would I consent to your proposal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Angrily the knight rode away, declaring
that he would return again in three
days more. The time passed very slowly
in the gloomy tower. In spite of the
raven&#8217;s faithful visits, the girls became
faint and weak from hunger.</p>

<p>On the sixth day Williswind was sitting
at the window, watching eagerly for
the bird&#8217;s return. Suddenly she saw the
figure of a knight come from the thicket.
As she looked at him, she saw that it was
not the robber knight; his armor was entirely
different. Hope came to her at
once, and she called out loudly and waved
her handkerchief through the bars.</p>

<p>The knight heard the call and turned in
the direction of the tower. Williswind
uttered a cry of rapture; it was her
brother. In his haste to reach home as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
quickly as possible, he had taken this path
through the forest.</p>

<p>Just at this moment the robber knight
came riding up. Seeing Othmar he challenged
him to fight. Down across the
open space before the tower the two horses
came, and met with a loud clash in the
center. Othmar held his saddle, but the
robber knight was stretched upon the
ground.</p>

<p>Othmar was not a little surprised when
he entered the old Castle to find that it
was his beloved sister who had called to
him from the tower. It was not long before
Williswind was safe once more in the
beautiful Castle of Stolzenfels.</p>

<p>Othmar was greatly pleased at the skill
with which the raven had provided for his
sister, so he adopted a new Coat-of-Arms,
with the raven as his emblem, and set the
little figure above the gate of the Castle,
to tell to all the world the story of the
faithful raven.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE NIGHT OF THE STOLEN
TREASURE</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> Hans and his mother were
standing down by the Mummelsee. It
was a big round sheet of water, surrounded
by rocky slopes. On these grew
dark pine trees, which cast their shadows
far out into the water.</p>

<p>The water lay quietly sleeping in its
dark bed. The stillness made little Hans
thoughtful, and he crept close to his
mother.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why is the water so still?&#8221; he whispered;
&#8220;and the fish,&mdash;where are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; answered his mother, &#8220;and I
will tell you a story. There are no longer
any fish in the Mummelsee; they left it
many, many years ago. The place is
haunted by Mummel, a great water god,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and by his daughters, the beautiful water
sprites.</p>

<p>&#8220;Long years ago,&#8221; the mother went on,
&#8220;a man committed a great crime in order
that he might get a rich treasure. In his
flight he came to the Mummelsee. He
could not swim across with the bag of
treasure! What should he do? He
knew that he would be caught unless he
did something at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Ah! I will just drop it into the edge
of the lake,&#8217; he said to himself. &#8216;The
water is dark and no one will be able to
find the Treasure. I will hide myself in
the thick bushes, and there I will be safe
also.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;He crawled into the bushes where they
were thickest. But something was
wrong; the bushes seemed like so many
hands, that caught hold of him, and held
him fast. He could not move. He
struggled and struggled, but the more he
fought against them, the more firmly they
held on.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&#8220;He gave up the struggle, and lay quiet,
looking out upon the dark water. He
saw something that was still more
strange. What could it be? It looked
like the form of a giant rising from the
water. The face was sterner than any
he had ever seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it, mother?&#8221; asked little
Hans; &#8220;was it a ghost?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was Mummel, the great angry god,
who haunts the lake. He had never allowed
his peace to be disturbed in the
slightest way. No one could throw even
a pebble into the lake without being punished
by him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now he rose out of the water; and
seized the frightened man. The bushes
let go their hold on him as if by magic;
and, without saying a word the stern god
began to sink down, down into the cold,
black water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; cried Hans, &#8220;was the man
drowned?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; answered his mother, &#8220;he was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
drowned. The great god drew him
down, down to the bottom of the lake,
where he has a wonderful palace. In it
there are all kinds of strange creatures.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what does the man do down there?
Is he still alive?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; Mummel will not let him die; but
keeps him, and makes him serve in the
kitchen year after year.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And does he not have any rest or any
holidays?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He does not need rest down there, because
he is no longer mortal like us. But
once a year he ceases, for a single night,
to serve in the kitchen. He becomes a
mortal again and comes back to earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every year on the day on which he
committed his crime, he puts on his
earthly clothes and comes up. And when
he reaches the world, he suddenly finds
himself at the place where he stole the
treasure.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i124.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;He hears some one coming, and starts
to flee with the treasure on his back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Each time, he comes to the same spot on
Mummelsee, and throws the sack into the
lake. Just as before, too, he tries to hide
in the bushes and is caught and held by
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every year Mummel, angry as before,
comes up and drags the man out of the
bushes, and draws him down to his palace
again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many people have heard the strange
noises in the bushes along the shore of the
lake. Some of them imagine, too, that
they have seen a strange form rising from
the waters. They declare that on this
night the lake is greatly disturbed. The
wind is loud, and the bushes bend their
heads down to the very water.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the night when these strange
things happen, people are careful to avoid
the place. Although they like to go there
at other times, they would not wish to be
found there on the Night of the Stolen
Treasure.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WATER SPRITES</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mummel,</span> the great angry water god,
has many beautiful daughters. These he
guards jealously, and will allow no one to
see them in their maiden forms except by
the dim moonlight.</p>

<p>These beautiful water nymphs are not
at all like their stern father. They are
pure, and gentle and graceful and kind.
They never do harm to anyone, and are
not displeased if people come to visit the
lake. Indeed they like to have people
come to see them dance upon the water at
night.</p>

<p>These lovely creatures would gladly
help people if their father did not guard
them so jealously; for they are kind-hearted
and generous.</p>

<p>As it is, all they can do for mortals is
to entertain them with their fairy dances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
on the silvery waters of Mummelsee. On
every moonlight night they can be seen
flitting about on the surface of that.</p>

<p>Their fairy forms are so charming that
people who see them cannot help forgetting
their daily cares. People come to
the lake tired and careworn in the evening,
and go away happy and cheerful.</p>

<p>All night long, till the first streaks of
dawn, the fairy nymphs can be seen, flitting
charmingly from wave to wave.
Their gowns are light and flowing like
gossamers. Their beautiful golden hair,
too, floats lightly on the gentle breeze.</p>

<p>Once or twice, it is said, daring youths
have been drawn by their beauty, and
have ventured into the lake to meet them.
Every attempt, however, has been disastrous.
Mummel has caught the intruder
and taken him down to his abode below
the lake. There the unhappy youth has
had to act as a servant.</p>

<p>Whenever anyone attempts to come too
close to his daughters, too, Mummel takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
away their human shapes at once. He
transforms them into water lilies, and
makes them stand with bowed heads along
the farther shore of the lake.</p>

<p>Every morning, too, as soon as the first
light of day begins to appear, the beautiful
figures leave their fairy dance upon
the lake. Mummel transforms them into
their lily forms and makes them stand in
the water along the shore.</p>

<p>So the beautiful water lilies which are
to be seen in Mummelsee are the lovely
water sprites, daughters of Mummel. No
one is allowed to pick one even to this day.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE GIANT MAIDEN</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> years ago there lived a mighty
race of giants. They were as tall as the
hills, and dwelt in great castles as large
as mountains. To them the world was a
very small place indeed.</p>

<p>These giants loved the world, however,
and all the many beautiful things in it.
The sunshine, the song of birds, the green
fields, the woods, the rivers, and the blue
sky were all charming to them.</p>

<p>So it was that they used to walk a great
deal. They used to go everywhere and
see everything that was good to see.
When they walked, however, they stepped
from hilltop to hilltop. They never went
down into the valleys.</p>

<p>The king of the giants was a great and
a good man. He was kind to his people,
and kind to his children, and they all loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and honored him. One of his children
was a beautiful girl. She would soon be
a woman, but she still loved playthings.</p>

<p>Like the rest of the giants, Hilda, the
king&#8217;s daughter, liked to go walking out
into the world. She often found most interesting
playthings. Sometimes she
would bring home a bear, or a baby elephant.</p>

<p>One day Hilda went out for a walk.
She had had to stay in the castle for
several days because of the rain. This
was a beautiful day, however, and she
walked a long way, even for a giant&#8217;s
daughter.</p>

<p>The maiden stepped over valley after
valley, from hilltop to hilltop, till she was
far away from home. She had never
gone so far before. The country seemed
quite different, and it was pleasant, too.</p>

<p>At last she stopped and looked about
her to enjoy the scene. Before her was a
wide valley, and in it she saw many
curious things. One of them was a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
plowing with horses. She had never seen
anything like that before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;what cute playthings
they will make! They will be real live
playthings, too. How nice the little creature
is that walks behind! And the thing
he is holding; that will make a fine toy.
And the other animals will be such lovely
pets. I must have them all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hilda reached down into the valley and
picked up the man, the plow, and the
horses, and tucked them away in her
apron. Then she went home to tell her
father.</p>

<p>&#8220;See what lovely playthings I have
found!&#8221; she called to him, as she ran into
the great castle.</p>

<p>&#8220;My darling child,&#8221; said the good King,
&#8220;these are not playthings. You must
take them back and leave them where you
found them. You must never touch them
again. This is a man, and he has a wife
and children at home. They will be very
sad if he does not come back to them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;By and by,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;the whole
world will be owned by little creatures
like this man, and we shall be no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s daughter was very sad
when she heard these things. She did
not want to give up such delightful playthings.
But she had a kind heart, and
she loved her father. She knew, too, that
he understood things much better than
she did. So she put the man, the plow,
and the horses into her apron again, and
took them back to the place where she
had found them.</p>

<p>The man was very happy when she set
him down in the field again. His good
wife, and his children were there, too; and
they rejoiced to see him again. They
feared something had happened to him.</p>

<p>The maiden looked on for a time,
wondering about it all. It made her glad
to see how happy the man and his wife
and children were. She was no longer,
sorry that she had given up her playthings,
and she went home with a light
heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE SWAN KNIGHT</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Elsa</span> was a very beautiful girl. She
lived with her father, the Duke of Brabant.
Her father loved her very much,
so they lived happily in their lovely home.
But one day Elsa&#8217;s father died, leaving
her all of his lands and castles. Then she
had no one to care for her, and she was
very unhappy indeed.</p>

<p>The Duke of Brabant had had a trusted
friend, Frederick of Telramund. He
undertook the care of Elsa; but he did not
guard the lonely maiden as her father
would have wished. Indeed, this man
tried to force her to marry him, that he
might obtain all of her wealth.</p>

<p>In vain the lovely Elsa declared she did
not love him. In vain she appealed to his
chivalry. He cared nothing for her tears,
but cruelly cast her into a damp prison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
close by the rushing river. There she
must suffer in loneliness until she would
obey the will of Telramund.</p>

<p>At last Elsa sent a long message to
Henry I. begging him for aid. He decided
that the matter should be settled
in the lists. Elsa should choose a champion
to fight with Frederick of Telramund.</p>

<p>Poor Elsa lost all hope when she heard
this decision. She knew full well that no
knight in the neighborhood would dare
accept a challenge from Telramund; for
Telramund had fought many times and
had never been defeated. Day after day
the herald sought someone to battle for
Elsa&#8217;s rights. It was as she had feared,
no one answered the call.</p>

<p>Forsaken by all, the orphan girl turned
to the helper of the helpless. Night and
day she knelt in her narrow cell and
prayed. In her great grief she struck her
breast with the rosary clasped in her little
hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>The little bell attached to the rosary,
gave forth a low tinkling sound. These
silvery tones were very soft and faint.
They could scarcely be heard above the
roar of the waters rushing past the tower.
But they floated out through the narrow
window into the open air.</p>

<p>The winds of heaven caught up the
sounds and whirled them rapidly away.
Farther and farther they traveled, louder
and louder they became. At last it seemed
as if all the bells on earth had united to
ring forth one grand deafening peal.</p>

<p>These loud and pleading tones reached
even into the far distant temple on Montsalvat.
Here King Parsifal and his train
of dauntless knights kept constant watch
over the Holy Grail. The King was
greatly alarmed by the tones. He knew
that some poor creature needed aid, and
so hastened into his inner temple.</p>

<p>Within this holy place there stood a
beautiful vase, giving forth its rosy light.
On its bright edge the King read the message<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
from heaven. &#8220;Send Lohengrin to
defend his future bride, but let her trust
him and never seek to know his origin.&#8221;
These were the strange words which met
the aged King&#8217;s eyes.</p>

<p>The King immediately sent for his son.
Lohengrin was a brave young knight.
He had been trained to receive the messages
of the Holy Grail with the most
perfect faith. When he heard the words
from his father, he put on his armor,
spoke his farewells, and at once prepared
to mount his waiting steed.</p>

<p>Suddenly sweet music fell upon his ear.
He had never heard anything like it on
land or sea. Soft, low, and sweet, it rose
and fell and rose again. Then, in the distance,
Lohengrin saw a stately swan come
floating toward him. It drew behind it a
little skiff. Nearer and nearer came the
stately swan, clearer and sweeter rose the
mystic strain. Both came to a pause close
by the shore where the wondering knight
stood.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>Lohengrin sprang at once into the skiff.
The swan took up its song again, and soon
bore him out of sight.</p>

<p>The day for the tournament had
dawned. The last preparations had been
made. Many knights had gathered to
view the scene. Yet not one dared to
offer himself as champion for the lovely
maiden.</p>

<p>Elsa clung to her prison bars. Tearfully
she repeated for the last time her
prayers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Send Thou the deliverer, O Lord!&#8221;
she cried.</p>

<p>All at once her sobs ceased. The far
away sounds of music fell comfortingly
upon her ear. She looked out eagerly.
There she beheld a spotless swan floating
gently down the stream, skillfully guiding
a little boat. In the boat a knight in full
armor lay fast asleep on a glittering
shield.</p>

<p>Just as the swan passed beneath the
window where Elsa stood, the knight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
awoke. His first glance rested upon her
tear-stained face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Weep no more, fair maiden!&#8221; he cried,
springing to his feet. &#8220;Fear naught! I
have come to defend you!&#8221;</p>

<p>The skiff passed on down the river.
The prison door opened, and Frederick of
Telramund appeared to lead Elsa to the
lists. A smile of triumph curled his cruel
lips as he heard the herald give the last
call for Elsa&#8217;s champion. The sound of
the trumpets died away and Frederick
had turned to address Elsa. Suddenly a
ringing voice came from the end of the
lists.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here am I, the Swan Knight, ready to
fight for the rights of the Princess. I will
win her cause or die.&#8221;</p>

<p>A cry of admiration arose from the
crowd, as they turned toward the Rhine.
There they saw a handsome knight, standing
erect in a tiny skiff drawn by a swan.
Spellbound they watched him. He sprang
lightly ashore and sent the swan away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
It floated down the river and out of sight,
giving forth its own beautiful, dreamy
song.</p>

<p>For a moment Lohengrin knelt at
Elsa&#8217;s feet, making a solemn vow to save
her. Then he mounted his waiting steed,
drew down his visor, and took his place
in the lists.</p>

<p>The struggle began. Breathlessly the
knights and ladies watched it. Nothing
could be heard but the clank of steel, the
heavy breathing of the two knights, and
the tramp of their horses feet. The dust
almost hid them from view.</p>

<p>Suddenly a terrible blow was heard.
The great frame of Frederick of Telramund
was seen to sway for a moment in
the saddle, then to fall and roll in the
dust. In a moment Lohengrin had dismounted.
He stood with one foot on
Telramund&#8217;s breast, ordering him to surrender.</p>

<p>Triumphant cries and joyful trumpets
told of the victory. Cheer after cheer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
rang through the summer air, as Lohengrin
knelt before Elsa once more. The
cries of the knights and ladies were loud
and long. They almost drowned Elsa&#8217;s
sweet voice as she bade her champion rise
and name his own reward.</p>

<p>Though the low spoken tones had been
unheeded by the people, not one word had
been lost by Lohengrin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tempt me not, oh noble lady!&#8221; he replied.
&#8220;Here at your feet where I would
linger forever, I cannot but confess how
much I love you, and how I hope some day
to claim your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>The pretty flush on Elsa&#8217;s soft cheeks
deepened at these words. The long
lashes drooped over the beautiful eyes.
Timidly she held out her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;You saved me, sir knight,&#8221; she softly
whispered. &#8220;I am yours!&#8221;</p>

<p>Not a word of this conversation had
been heard by the people, for their shouts
had been redoubled as the knight bent low
over Elsa&#8217;s hand and pressed it to his lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>Before night, however, Elsa&#8217;s promise
to become the knight&#8217;s bride had gone
abroad. Preparations for the marriage
were begun at once.</p>

<p>Elsa had trembled with fear at the
thought of a union with Frederick of
Telramund, yet she did not hesitate in the
least to give herself to the strange knight
who had saved her. Nor did she doubt
him when he told her that she must never
seek to know either his name or his origin.</p>

<p>These must remain a secret from her
and from all the people or they would
have to part forever.</p>

<p>Many knights and ladies attended the
marriage ceremony. The young Lohengrin
and his lovely bride lived peacefully
and happily for many years. Their love
for each other grew deeper and better as
one by one three beautiful children came
to add to their happiness.</p>

<p>But Elsa, though perfectly content with
her husband&#8217;s unchanging love, could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
but notice that many of her people secretly
doubted him. They tried many times,
and in many different ways to discover
his name and origin.</p>

<p>Little by little, she, too, began to
wonder. The more she thought of it, the
more she longed to know her husband&#8217;s
secret. Finally, as she was seated by him
one day, she suddenly turned to him and
asked the forbidden question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Elsa! Elsa! Is your faith dead?&#8221;
cried the Swan Knight in broken voice.
&#8220;Can you no longer trust me? I love you
so, and now I must leave you. Our happiness
is at an end! But, before I go,
your question shall be answered. Come
with me!&#8221;</p>

<p>His pale face and despairing glance
brought Elsa to her senses. With a loving
cry she flung herself on his breast,
begging him to forgive and forget her
question. He sadly shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too late, Elsa,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;too
late! You have doubted me; and I must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
leave you; but before I go you shall know
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>The knights had gathered in the great
banqueting hall near the Rhine. They
started up in surprise when their master
suddenly came in their midst. He led the
pale and weeping Elsa gently by the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, oh, knights,&#8221; he began. &#8220;The
time has come when I must leave you.
Before I go, it is right that you should
know that I am Lohengrin, son of Parsifal,
the great king. I was sent hither by
the Holy Grail, to save your princess,
Elsa, from Frederick of Telramund.
Now the Holy Vessel calls me and I must
go. Ere I depart, I ask you to watch
faithfully over my little ones and to wipe
away their mother&#8217;s tears. Farewell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then in the midst of the silence which
followed these words, while he held Elsa
in a last fond embrace, the low strains of
the sweet music again came floating down
the Rhine. A moment later the swan appeared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>Slowly Lohengrin tore himself away
from Elsa&#8217;s trembling arms. He sprang
down the steps and into the waiting swan
boat. Away it glided to the strains of
sad music, and bore him out of sight forever.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
